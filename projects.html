          <h3>Project Purpose & Goals</h3>
          <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            Deja Vu is a web application developed as a final project for Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp. The goal of the project was to create a functional website in a limited amount of time while being well-designed with real-world applications. Deja Vu aims to be a collaborative project between the team of developers, allowing users to share experiences with their friends. The main purpose of Deja Vu is to bring people closer together by providing a platform for sharing experiences.

          </p>
          <h3>Web Stack and Explainations</h3>
          <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>Deja Vu was developed using Ruby and the Rails framework, with PostgreSQL serving as its database management system. The frontend was designed with HTML5 (featuring ERB), styled with SCSS and Bootstrap 5.1, and made dynamic with JavaScript and the Stimulus framework. The MapBox API was utilized to create interactive maps, and user photos were hosted through the Cloudinary API, providing users with a comprehensive and seamless experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Challenges and thought process</h3>
          <p>
            I faced a challenge while creating the user dashboard as I wanted to design it as a command center for our users. My goal was to make it accessible and easy to use by incorporating numerous features, information, and routes. To achieve this, I utilized JavaScript to implement hidden tabs, allowing users to switch between content, their personal information, and actions seamlessly without page reloads. I also created a friend relation for our user model  with invitation functionality. To achieve this, we created an invitation model. The Invitation model belongs to the User model and has methods to check for confirmed, pending, and reacted records between two users. It also has a method to find a specific invitation record between two users. The User model uses these methods to handle friend requests and keep track of a user's friends.

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p> Quizzle is a spanish-english quiz game application designed for users to challenge themselves by completing a auto-generated quiz everyday while motivating them through cross site leaderboards, personal leaderboards, and streaks. </p>
          <h5> Core Features:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Quiz game with dynamic JavaScript</li>
            <li>User accounts with login validation</li>
            <li>Streak tracking feature for users</li>
            <li>Daily auto-generated questions</li>
            <li>User profile pages displaying personal information and statistics</li>
            <li>Index page featuring three different ranking tables</li>
            <li> User sessions</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Project Purpose & Goals</h3>
          <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            Quizzle was developed as my final project for Harvard CS50 while I was working as an ESL teacher in Mostoles, Spain. My intention was to create an application that my students could utilize as an educational activity.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Web Stack and Explainations</h3>
          <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span> This web application was built using Python with the Flask web framework and utilized SQLite3 as the database. The front-end was developed using HTML5, CSS, and the Bootstrap 5.1 framework. Jinja2 was used as the template engine for generating HTML content.
          </p>
          <h3>Challenges and thought process</h3>
          <p>Initially, I had planned to update new questions and streaks automatically at 00:00 UTC time, but I encountered challenges when trying to implement this. As an alternative, I created a file that serves an "almost automation" function when the index is loaded. It always calls the check_date() function that performs a SQL query to check whether the date has changed or not. If the date is different, the start_day() method is called which deletes and inserts new random questions and checks users' streaks.
            In the update_streaks() method, the program iterates through all the users, check if they played yesterday. If the user played then their streak iterates, if not their streak returns to 0.
